# This guide implements HTML+NGINX on Debian
# It assumes you are reading instructions, and copy/pasting commands

# install dependencies on VPS or machine
apt -y install nginx tor git;

# configurations on Debian tend to be in /etc/nginx
# Check here if you have issues after following instructions

# By Default, html files are in
# /usr/share/nginx/html
# If you change the html there and it doesn't render, then your files are in
# /var/www/html

# Let's get to where the html files are rendered, replace this for your system
cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# get  copy of html files

git clone
https://github.com/AnonymousOperators/Website.git

sudo mv Website/HTML/* /usr/share/nginx/html

# confirm change
ls
# New files should show up

sudo nginx -s reload

# Use ctrl + f5 to refresh your browser. The files should render on your website.
# Congrats! You're done!
